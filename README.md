This repository introduces modern data-driven supply chain management techniques. Specific focus will be on supply chain efficiency and resiliency. The topics include supply chain tailoring, robust supply network design, data-driven sales and operations planning and inventory management, deep tier supply network visibility and risk identification, and supply chain coordination. We will use operations research, simulation, graph theoretic, and machine learning methods relevant to supply chain management.
